Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?) The purpose of this app is to enable users to find hikes by state. The website will provide information for a hike after it is selected from a randomly generated given list. The user will be able to add this hike to his own list. To have access to this feature, the user will have to create a basic account. 

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

Some CRUD functionalities
Signup/Login 
Random hike suggestor - WILL DEVELOP INTO THIS WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS - Working on figma how I want my project to look like, step by step. 

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

-JS, HTML, CSS and React
-C# Backend 
-Three.JS to come up with some cool features I am thinking about for the background, buttons, transitions, etc.

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

** FOR THE MVP I am focusing on having the search functionality work, make the API call/db search and finally displaying all the trail info  into a new page from there I will move onto the all the artistic stuff I am explaining right below**

- The MVP should be able to provide me with different suggested hikes in a state, I want to create some time of ROULETTE type-looking suggestor, that whenever the zip code is inputted a list of 4 hikes randomly displays and the user will be able to click on them to see all CRUD.

-Style in a very specific way all the CRUD functionalities.

- This may sound strange but I want to an inconclusive approach to this project, where the user can end up reaching his end-goal BUT through a less conventional/arstistic way. I am happy to explain more on a 1-1 call at any time which will also help me understand if this is more of a front-end or backend oriented project. 

-Style the backgrounds on three.js, WILL DEVELOP.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- I am not sure yet, ive been looking into different repos of websites that I am drawing inspiration from to see which other libraries or technolgies I may need. I may need more DBs which may only contain images etc, but I will focus on that once I get to the front end part. For the next couple of days I want to get the MVP fully working and that will give me much more clear understanding. 

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

Just to give us the freedom of doing things from an unconventional approach even if they arent the best practices, will happily discuss this on a 1-1 anytime.
